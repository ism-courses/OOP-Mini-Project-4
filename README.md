We are helping the client to enhance a Payroll System, here are the steps:

1. First, you need to analyze the **calculate_payroll** function in the **.py** file in this repository.
2. Based on the given code, you must determine the required class attributes. After meeting with your client, you determined that all the missing attributes are shared by all the instances of each class, so they should be class attributes.
3. Assign realistic values to them.
